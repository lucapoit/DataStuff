# Data Analysis Project - Alura's 7 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to the Data Analysis project, completed as part of Alura's **7 Days of Code** challenge. This repository showcases my journey through the daily challenges, focusing on extracting insights and performing analyses on a provided dataset.

## Overview

Alura's **7 Days of Code** is a challenge where participants receive daily tasks related to data analysis. Each challenge builds upon the previous day, guiding you through the steps necessary to analyze and manipulate a database effectively. Although solutions were provided the day after each challenge, I completed all tasks independently, using the solutions only for confirmation and further learning.

## Project Structure

  - The Jupyter notebooks used to solve the daily challenges.
  - Outputs and visualizations generated during the analysis.


## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured the dataset was free from inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gained insights into the data through various visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized libraries such as Matplotlib to create visual representations of the findings.
